# How to use?

Pass the path of input.txt file in the final_sol function along with the output.txt file path. The program will automatically update the output.txt. In case the output path is not given, a file named 'output.txt' will be generated in the directory.

## Example Usage:

final_sol('/Users/souhardyadas/Desktop/assignment/input.txt','/Users/souhardyadas/Desktop/assignment/output.txt')
